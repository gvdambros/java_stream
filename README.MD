# Java Stream API Exercises

## Introduction

This GitHub project was created to serve as a playground for practicing Java Stream API.

It is a Spring Boot project with a example data model, repositories and a set of pre-defined data. The system automatically loads data into H2 in-memory database when the Spring Boot app starts up. Therefore, you can fetch data from database by calling repositories and experiment the usage of Java Stream API.
